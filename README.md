# MultivariateAnalysis ðŸ“Š

This repository contains assignment work for the **STAT40150 Multivariate Analysis** module at **University College Dublin (UCD)**.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Explored
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Multivariate Normal Distribution
- Covariance and Correlation Structure
- Hypothesis Testing for Multivariate Means
- Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)

â€“ R scripts and reports related to data preprocessing, multivariate testing, and classification.
- `Subject_Info_Data.csv` â€“ Datasets used for analysis.
-  Visualization outputs (scree plots, scatter matrices, etc.).

## ðŸ›  Tools & Languages
- R
- ggplot2
- MASS
- dplyr
- psych

## âœ… Highlights
- Performed PCA to reduce dimensionality and interpret loading structures.
- Applied multivariate normality tests and MANOVA for hypothesis testing.
- Built classification models using LDA and QDA for pressure data.
